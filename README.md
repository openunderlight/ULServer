Install
CentOS 7
AWS
Create a new EC2 instance in your region of choice.
For now use CentOS. Technically any distro should work but Underlight uses CentOS for its SELinux capabilities. Note: Amazon doesn't have an AMI of its own for CentOS, but you can get it for free in the AMI Marketplace.
Open ports 7500-7509 TCP in/out.
Open port 80 if you want an HTTP server.
Open all inbound/outbound UDP traffic. This will be necessary for agents.
Log on as centos@ec2-blah.12.34.56.78 with the pem/ppk provided during setup of your instance.
sudo adduser ulprod
sudo su
cd ~ulprod
cat authorized_keys
Now paste your public SSH key into here. It can be the same as the one for your root access but it SHOULDN'T BE, I mean are you INSANE?
chmod 700 .ssh/
chmod 600 authorized_keys
restorecon -R -v .ssh

Note: Be sure to remember the root password for MariaDB. This will be needed for configuring the server after building.

cd /usr/lib64 ln -s libmysqlclient.so.18 libmysqlclient.so

vi /etc/my.cnf.d/server.cnf

Uncomment the line bind-address=0.0.0.0 and enable skip-name-resolve

Restart MariaDB

systemctl restart mariadb

Clone Repository & Build
For security it is best to build and run server as a regular user. The development environment user is 'uldev'. The test and production servers use 'ulprod'. The instructions following assume cloning and building will be done from the current user home directory.

git clone ssh://git@ulgit.koiware.com:423/KoiWare/ulserver.git

cd $HOME/ulserver/build

meson ..

ninja

Install Server
cd $HOME/ulserver/build/scripts

./install.sh

Follow the prompts for entering the root password and IP address assignment.

Load Level Files
Copy the server level files generated by the level editor to $HOME/lyra/src

cd $HOME/lyra/src

make level

Start Server
cd $HOME/lyra/bin

./ulctl start

Shutdown Server
cd $HOME/lyra/bin ./ulctl stop
