If that is their belief I don\'t think we should force them to fight (even on our plane). I would suggest that if they take a stance to not participate in any way to fighting, that we could tell them that they need to at least assist in restoring, carrying items, scouting, etc. I don\'t see many (if any) situation where there would be a need to force someone to fight if it is against their beliefs.

I think it\'d be best to put someone in this position that tries to keep peace, reviews things from multiple angles, and advises with a crisp understanding of what we *should* be doing. I also think someone with experience is much needed, and would argue that the entire leadership body be structured where you and Fangx are at the top perhaps a new crop of guardians installed. Perhaps Darby can serve in that role, but I think she at least needs to speak up about this potential change and the recent events.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I\'d recommend:  Tamarisk, hannababy, and Cianne in that order.

The fact that these actions were undertaken at the \"sole discretion\" of one Ruler is indicative of an underlying problem.

Until such a charter is established, I do not believe it is prudent to promote -anyone- to a position of greater responsibility. You have a rare opportunity to fix some of these systemic problems.

I will begin with my own first...\r\n\r\nOnly a few weeks ago Acerrav was found in the Mission Board room without his crest.

It is also a Lyceum rule to always give the original author credit at the end of the scroll(s) -  example: “Blah, blah, blah.” - Jade. We do not transcribe things unless something needs to be condensed. Sometimes all it needs is a few unnecessary words removed to make a series shorter.

The Vanguard and Templars were based on the old FreeSoul Knights and Illuminate Brigade from the Lyran era.\r\n\r\nThe Vanguard basically condemned everyone else as murderers and destroyers, declaring open war on them and the intent to utterly destroy them.  The Realms Watch formed from the first Idoaclesian refugees... mainly their elders (Kal\'lankissa, etc..).  Both the Templars and Realms Watch were willing to share the city and did not press any serious hostilities beyond skirmishes.  \r\n\r\nZaxun changed that when he gained the Mace of Castigation from an Idoaclesian traitor (believed to be Bandaret), and organized a surprise attack on the first Centurian (leader) of the Realms Watch.

The Realms Watch and the Templars stayed closely allied and fought together, while the Vanguard split away, refusing to aid at least one city because of the presence of the Templars and Watch.  This led to that cities (Valoura) fall and destruction.\r\n\r\nThe Vanguard shortly after wards joined up with the Arretian, Kadatorii, and Hota forces (once the Hota and Kadatorii joined forces) to attack the Furyan City.',0,1,0),(12194,700,'2016-06-04',10750,10066,'Arnaya: Information 3','At this point, Blade, Tember, Jade, Ras, Zsa, Tam, and I conducted our scout and raid at a critical juncture of the Furyan seige and got our first look at Zaxun as he advanced single handedly on a reinforced position of Furyan Defenders that were holding a breech in the walls.  Zaxun was untouched by any attacks (same trick as he used last night I assume) from anyone, and tore through the defenders with his mace. \r\n\r\nShortly after that, we found out that Underlight was his next destination.

Zaxun seems to be using the Soul Essences of slain opponents to create Revenants of those that have fallen.  These Revenants seem to be an amalgam of the Dreamer they once were (in form particularly), and different forms of mare.  The routine ones seem to have lost much of their will and intellect, though use Blade and Projectile in combat.  They have been noted using Darkness, Firestorms, Tempests, and REALLY seem to love Abjure.  Their damage capacity seems to be roughly on par with a Shamblix, and can take similar amounts of damage to a Horron (havn\'t been able to confirm exactly).  They use these abilities in a similar manner to an Agoknights Blast.

The house is running smoothly with the leadership as is right now and the house is definitely going on the right track to becoming whole once again.  With that said, here are some opinions that I have.\r\n\r\nSnow Angel - She has previous experience plus she has shown she can handle diplomatic situations in a calm and collective manner.  She is around readily enough (about the same as you or Tman) and can keep up with the current events of the city.  Her downside is sometimes she can rely too much on the past of the house which affects her judgement in the present situation of the house.  She\'s walked out on meetings when they haven\'t went her way and also been frustrated because the house didn\'t align with how it used to be.  However I believe her good points override that bad point and she can slip into the role of Guardian just fine.',0,1,0),(13633,856,'2016-08-04',10007,10311,'Dina: 400 strength','I was running around Lower Basins, a good place for bogroms, but I was on a mission and during the mission, I trapped 400 strength.',0,1,0),(13634,856,'2016-08-04',10007,10311,'Dina: By the way','This last post was for another 400 strength, so I didn\'t want you to get confused.

With her she has all the same qualities as Snow in the good sense, she also keeps reports of goings on of the city, works well with other houses.  On the surface an overall good choice.  However if you look past that and watch her, she has some worrying habits that would make me leery as a Guradian.  1. She has a knack of trying to put herself in the middle of everything.  Now being in the middle of situations isn\'t a bad thing, but trying to insert yourself in every little thing that happens in the city can make you look like you just want attention. And that\'s how it has come off to me sometimes.  2. I feel her personal opinions of people or things may impact how she handles some situations. When getting reports I have read some rather snarky and overall rude comments that she has made about situations or persons. If someone feels that strongly about that in just writing, how do we know she will have a neutral outlook when dealing with situations.',0,1,0),(13636,590,'2016-08-04',10916,10746,'Aileron: Thoughts Pt 3','Lastly is one I have seen work her way back up to something I would honestly say is Guardian worthy.

Where there was once a negative and very bitter person is someone who is more light and caring for her fellow member and willing to do work for the house.  She is around often enough and once again has done the job before so she knows what it takes and how to handle diplomatic situations.  The only thing I would say is I wouldn\'t raise her above a Guardian.  She would actually probably agree.  She has been forthcoming about her Rulership and we know it caused her to leave the city.  A Knight has less stress but also fulfills the role that she enjoys so well, taking care of her fellow house members.\r\n\r\nIn closing my top two choices would be Snow or Clarity.

She began her assault. Eventually Arlyana, then Kailee, then Lio arrived, and they all continued their assult.
